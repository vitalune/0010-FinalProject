## Project Overview
We determine Pittsburgh's most livable neighborhood using three data-driven metrics: green infrastructure (trees), safety (crime rates), and city facilities availability.

## Our Metric: Livability Score
**Livability Score = (Green Space × 0.4) + (Safety × 0.35) + (Facilities × 0.25)**

We weighted green space highest because environmental quality is fundamental to livability.

## Datasets Used
1. [City Trees](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/city-trees) - 40,000+ street trees with location and benefits data
2. [Police Incident Blotter](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/arrest-data) - Crime incident records by neighborhood
3. [City Facilities](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/city-of-pittsburgh-facilities) - Public facilities and services locations
4. [Pittsburgh Neighborhoods](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/neighborhoods2) - Geographic boundaries for analysis
