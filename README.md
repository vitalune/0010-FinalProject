## Project Overview
We analyze Pittsburgh neighborhoods using data-driven metrics to determine the most livable neighborhood based on green space, safety, and city service responsiveness.

## Our Metric: Livability Score
**Livability Score = (Green Space × 0.4) + (Safety × 0.35) + (Service Responsiveness × 0.25)**

## Datasets Used
1. [City Trees](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/city-trees) - Tree inventory for green space analysis
2. [Police Incident Blotter](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/police-incident-blotter) - Crime data for safety analysis  
3. [311 Service Requests](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/311-data) - City service response data
4. [Pittsburgh Neighborhoods](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/neighborhoods2) - Geographic boundaries
